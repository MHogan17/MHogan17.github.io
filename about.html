                Hello!
            </h2>
            <p>
                Thanks for visiting my webpage! My current program of study is towards a Ph.D. in Phyiscs (Emphasis in Biological Physics) 
                at the University of Utah (the U) in Salt Lake City. I completed my M.S. in Physics 
                at the U in 2024, and expect to defend my doctoral dissertation in 2027. I was born 
                and raised in Logan, Utah where I attended Utah State University (USU) and earned my B.S.
                in Physics in 2021 summa cum laude, with minors in mathematics and computer science.

                My current research is focused on hyperspectral super-resolution microscopy (or nanoscopy) to resolve nanometer-scale
                structures and individual proteins to uncover the working principles behind basic biological processes.
                More broadly, I am interested in finding elegent soltuions to complex problems. I like breaking things down 
                to their individual parts to understand the physical mechanisms that govern them. During my undergraduate 
                research I built a computer model of the surface of the leaf and uncovered an interesting implication that
                leaves could be the "brains" of plants (or at least are, in some way, responsible for optimal resource distribution)
                when it comes to photosynthesis in a dynamic environment. My Master's thesis was concerened with solving the problem of
                compressing diffraction-limited images to maximize storage efficiency over the long term.

                From a young age, I have always had an aptitude for mathematics. This was perhaps a result of my parent's choice of moniker
                for me: Matthew Thomas Hogan; not only is "math" phonetically built into my first name, my initials are just an "a" short.
                As a kid on the playground, I heard every form of the joke. Nevertheless, my interests grew beyond math when I took my first
                physics class as a high school sophomore. When I learned we could use math to describe the reality of our world, and could take 
                it a step further to gain deeper insights, I was hooked. Since then, every class I've taken and project I've worked on has 
                just added more and more tools to my belt to pursue this goal.
