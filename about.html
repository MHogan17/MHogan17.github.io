                Hello!
            </h2>
            <p>
                Thanks for visiting my webpage! My current program of study is towards a Ph.D. in Phyiscs (Emphasis in Biological Physics) 
                at the University of Utah (the U) in Salt Lake City. I completed my M.S. in Physics 
                at the U in 2024, and expect to defend my doctoral dissertation in 2027. I was born 
                and raised in Logan, Utah where I attended Utah State University (USU) and earned my B.S.
                in Physics in 2021 summa cum laude, with minors in Mathematics and Computer Science.

                My current research is focused on hyperspectral super-resolution microscopy (or hyper-nanoscopy) to resolve many nanometer-scale
                structures and individual proteins simultaneously to uncover the working principles behind basic biological processes.
                More broadly, I am interested in finding elegent soltuions to complex problems. I like breaking things down 
                to their individual parts to understand the physical mechanisms that govern them. This was much to the chagrin of
                my family growing up as I took apart countless household electronics because I didn't belive they operated on magic.

                From a young age, I have always shown an aptitude for mathematics. This was perhaps a result of my parent's choice of moniker
                for me: Matthew Thomas Hogan; not only is "math" phonetically built into my first name, my initials are just an "a" short as well.
                As a kid on the playground, I heard every form of the joke. Nevertheless, my interests grew beyond math when I took my first
                physics class as a high school sophomore. There, I learned how we could use math to describe the reality of our world, and could take 
                those models a step further to gain deeper insights. After that, I was hooked. Since then, every class I've taken and project I've worked on has 
                just added more and more tools to my belt in pursuit of understanding. For instance, I wrote this website myself in HTML and CSS, which I learned how 
                to do because I was curious about web development. My preferred programming language is Python, but I'm also familiar with Java, C/C++, and MATLAB. Of course, there is a lot
                of software out there these days, so I'm familiar with the concept of reading (and writing) documentation.

                During my undergraduate years at USU I took the Biology 1600 series, where I met my undergraduate research advisor Keith Mott.
                In his lab, in collaboration with David Peak, I researched plant stomata and gas exchange during photosynthesis and built 
                a computer model of a leaf's surface. After 3 years of work I uncovered an interesting implication that
                leaves are the "brains" of plants (or at least are, in some way, responsible for optimal resource distribution)
                when it comes to photosynthesis in a dynamic environment.

                After graduating USU in 2021, I immediately enrolled as a graduate student at the U. On the heels of the 2020 pandemic, 
                I was interested in research conducted by Michael Vershinin and Saveez Saffarian on the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus
                responsible for COVID-19. There I was introduced to the concept of the diffraction limit and super-resolution microscopy.
                My Master's thesis was concerened with solving the problem of compressing diffraction-limited PSF images to maximize storage 
                efficiency over the long term. After completing this computation-heavy project, I realized I wanted to focus on more biologically relevant work,
                leading me to Erik Jorgensen's lab and his work with Jordan Gerton on PSF engineering for hyperspectral localization microscopy.

                After I graduate next year, I want to do something.
