                Hello, and thanks for being here!
            </h2>
            <p>
                My current program of study is towards a Ph.D. in Phyiscs (Emphasis in Biological Physics) 
                at the University of Utah (the U) in Salt Lake City. I completed a Master's in Physics 
                from the U in 2024, and expect to defend my dissertation in 2027. I was born 
                and raised in Logan, Utah, where I attended Utah State University (USU) and earned my Bachelor's
                in Physics in 2021.

                My current research is focused on super-resolution microscopy (or nanoscopy) to resolve nanometer-scale
                structures and individual proteins to uncover the working principles behind basic biological processes.
                More broadly, I am interested in finding elegent soltuions to complex problems. I like breaking things down 
                to their individual parts to understand the physical mechanisms that govern them. During my undergraduate 
                research I built a computer model of the surface of the leaf and uncovered an interesting implication that
                leaves could be the "brains" of plants (or at least are, in some way, responsible for resource distribution)
                when it comes to photosynthesis in a dynamic environment.
