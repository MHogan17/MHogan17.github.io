            <h2>Hello, and thanks for being here!</h2>
            My current program of study is towards a Ph.D. in Phyiscs (Emphasis in Biological Physics) 
            at the University of Utah (the U) in Salt Lake City. I completed a Master's in Physics 
            from the U in 2024, and expect to defend my dissertation in 2027. I was born 
            and raised in Logan, Utah, where I attended Utah State University (USU) and earned my Bachelor's
            in Physics in 2021.

            My current research is focused on super-resolution microscopy (or nanoscopy) to resolve nanometer-scale
            structures and individual proteins to uncover the working mechanisms behind basic biological processes.
